## Notice on the Use of Generative Coding Tools

Students are hereby advised that the use of generative coding assistance platforms, including but not limited to ChatGPT, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any comparable automated code-synthesis services, is strictly prohibited in the completion of this assignment.

This restriction is imposed to ensure that all submitted work reflects the independent reasoning, technical proficiency, and creative problem-solving skills of the student. Any reliance on external automated generation tools undermines both the educational objectives of the course and the academic integrity standards of this institution.

Violations of this policy will be regarded as a breach of the academic honesty code and will be subject to disciplinary measures as outlined in the universityâ€™s regulations. Students are expected to exercise integrity and diligence in producing original work that authentically represents their own knowledge and effort.

By undertaking this assignment, you affirm your commitment to these principles and acknowledge that compliance with this directive is not only a matter of academic regulation but also of professional responsibility.
